Here I list all the projects that I have been a part of so far, in roughly reverse chronological order

* ### Mr. DLib - Evaluating Research Paper Recommender Systems
	Aug 2016 - Jul 2017
	Mr. DLib is a RESTful web service that provides related recommendations for research papers. It can be thought of as a Netflix for research papers. In this project, I, along with 4 others and the guidance of Dr. Joeran Beel, implemented a RESTful web service that catered to 200,000 daily requests for recommendations of related research papers from among the 24 million papers in our corpus. For this we used Apache Lucene-Solr and Java Jersey.  
	
	Following the setup of the platform, I implemented a randomizer and A/B testing engine to automatically construct recommendation algorithms for requests received. I expanded the choice of recommendation approaches on the Mr. DLib platform by bringing to production a recommender system which implements natural language processing techniques. This approach is now configured to deal with 50% of all recommendation requests.
* ### Generating Topic Heirarchies from Text data
* ### Image To Poem Convertor
* ### Benchmarking UCI-ML Datasets for a hidden layer neural network
