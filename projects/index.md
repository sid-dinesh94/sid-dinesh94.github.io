Here I list all the projects that I have been a part of so far, in roughly reverse chronological order

* ### Text Integration - Integrating heterogenous text data sources
	Oct 2017 - Still at it

	Here are examples of my attempts to integrate Social media posts (weibo) and Chinese news articles. <a href="/projects/textIntegration"> This is the link </a>
	
	
* ### SmartReply system at GoDaddy
	Jun 2018 - Sep 2018
	
	I built a response suggestion system that displays potential answers to incoming text messages on the SmartLine mobile app. This work involved Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, Platform development, as well as Android development. A poster detailing my work can be found [here](/docs/Poster.pdf).

* ### Mr. DLib - Evaluating Research Paper Recommender Systems
	Aug 2016 - Jul 2017
	Mr. DLib is a RESTful web service that provides related recommendations for research papers. It can be thought of as a Netflix for research papers. In this project, I, along with 4 others and the guidance of Dr. Joeran Beel, implemented a RESTful web service that catered to 200,000 daily requests for recommendations of related research papers from among the 24 million papers in our corpus. For this we used Apache Lucene-Solr and Java Jersey.  
	
	Following the setup of the platform, I implemented a randomizer and A/B testing engine to automatically construct recommendation algorithms for requests received. I expanded the choice of recommendation approaches on the Mr. DLib platform by bringing to production a recommender system which implements natural language processing techniques. This approach is now configured to deal with 50% of all recommendation requests.
* ### Generating Topic Heirarchies from Text data
* ### Image To Poem Convertor
	I created a web-app that will search for a relevant poem for an image of the user's choosing and presents it to the user. The github repository is <a href="https://github.com/sakshiudeshi/ImageToPoetryConverter"> here </a>. I do not have a working deployment right now, but it an be rebooted from the repository.
