Here I list all the projects that I have been a part of so far, in roughly reverse chronological order


* Mr. DLib - Evaluating Research Paper Recommender Systems
	Aug 2016 - Jul 2017
	Mr. DLib is a RESTful web service that provides related recommendations for research papers. It can be thought of as a Netflix for research papers. In this project, I, along with 4 others and the guidance of Dr. Joeran Beel, implemented a RESTful web service that catered to 200,000 daily requests for recommendations of related research papers from among the 24 million papers in our corpus. For this we used Apache Lucene-Solr and Java Jersey.
