title: Without Retweets
---

This folder has the examples created using *LDA topic clustering* with all tweets that do not have hashtags or have hashtags which occur less than 5 times. There is only one copy of each leftover tweet. The folder has five parts. One folder for each day that I clustered. These files are prefixed with the date of the set of weibo posts used in the example.

The accessible examples are:
* <h2><a href="/projects/textIntegration/clustered/March6/index.html">March 6</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="/projects/textIntegration/clustered/March7/index.html">March 7</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="/projects/textIntegration/clustered/March12/index.html">March 12</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="/projects/textIntegration/clustered/March15/index.html">March 15</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="/projects/textIntegration/clustered/March24/index.html">March 24</a></h2>
