The examples are laid out into three folders. In all these cases tweets have been used as the starting point to generate events.
* ## Seed Hashtags: <a href="seeded">Link to seeded</a>
* ## Random hashtags without removal of retweets: <a href="withRT">Link to random with Retweets present</a>
* ## Random hashtags with retweets removed: <a href="withoutRT">Link to random with Retweets removed</a>
* ## Clustered Leftover Tweets: <a href="clustered">Link to examples of clustered leftover tweets</a>

The seed hashtag folder is further divided into:
* ## Examples with retweets removed 
* ## Examples without retweets removed

The seed hashtags have been taken from the Politics and Finance seeds provided to me.
