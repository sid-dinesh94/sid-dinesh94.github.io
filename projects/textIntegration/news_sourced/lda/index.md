title: LDA Clustering of News Articles
---

This folder has the examples created using *LDA topic clustering* with all newspaper articles using terms that are present in not more than 50% of the news articles. The folder has five parts. One folder for each day that was clustered. These files are prefixed with the date of the set of weibo posts used in the example.

The accessible examples are:
* <h2><a href="March4/index.html">March 4</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="March6/index.html">March 6</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="March8/index.html">March 8</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="March10/index.html">March 10</a></h2>
* <h2><a href="March12/index.html">March 12</a></h2>
