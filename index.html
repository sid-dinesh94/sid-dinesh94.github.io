	<p> Here is a photo of me at the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland. I was lucky to spend 5 months in Dublin, Ireland during my undergraduate days. </p>
	<p> Right now, I'm a second year student at the University of California, San Diego pursuing a Master's in Computer Science. I plan to graduate in March 2019, hopefully after I write a master's thesis. I've primarily focused on NLP having taken 2 courses on recommender systems by Dr. Julian McAuley, a course on Advanced NLP offered by Prof. Ndapa Nakashole as well as courses in the fields of HCI and Data Science.

	<p>Before coming to UCSD as a grad student, I studied Computer Science and Economics  
		at <em><a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in">BITS Pilani</a></em>. During my undergraduate education, I wrote an undergraduate thesis 
		about evaluating baselines of recommender systems for research publications with <a href="http://www.mr-dlib.org"> Mr. DLib</a>. When I'm away
		from the computer screen, I enjoy writing, jogging, and biking in the outdoors. Read more about my exciting 
		non-academic life over at my <a href="https://siddharthdinesh.wordpress.com"> wordpress site</a>.</p>
	<p> The rest of this website is a work in progress. I will soon have more detailed descriptions of my projects.</p>
