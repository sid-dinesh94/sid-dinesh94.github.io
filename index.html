	<p> Here's is a photo of me sitting on a bench in Sankien garden near Yokohama, Japan. I was lucky to spend 5 months in Tokyo during my undergraduate days.
	Right now, I'm a first year Master's of Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of California, San Diego. I plan to graduate in March 2019, hopefully after I write a master's thesis. 
		In my first quarter, I've enrolled myself in 2 courses on recommender systems by Dr. Julian McAuley and attend three seminars in the fields of HCI and Data Science. I hope this combination of courses will best prepare me for a productive 21 months in graduate school.

	<p>Before coming to UCSD as a grad student, I studied Computer Science and Economics  
		at <em><a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in">BITS Pilani</a></em>. During my undergraduate education, I wrote an undergraduate thesis 
		about evaluating baselines of recommender systems for research publications with <a href="http://www.mr-dlib.org"> Mr. DLib</a>. When I'm away
		from the computer screen, I enjoy writing, jogging, and biking in the outdoors. Read more about my exciting 
		non-academic life over at my <a href="https://siddharthdinesh.wordpress.com"> wordpress site</a>.</p>
